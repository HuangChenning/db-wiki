MySQL 5.7 Reference Manual Including MySQL NDB Cluster 7.5 and NDB Cluster 7.6

### 21.5.12 ndb\_drop\_table — Drop an NDB Table

**ndb\_drop\_table** drops the specified [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md) table. (If you try to use this on a table created with a storage engine other than [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md), the attempt fails with the error 723: No such table exists.) This operation is extremely fast; in some cases, it can be an order of magnitude faster than using a MySQL [`DROP         TABLE`](drop-table.md) statement on an [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md) table.

#### Usage

```
ndb_drop_table -c connection_string tbl_name -d db_name
```

Options that can be used with **ndb\_drop\_table** are shown in the following table. Additional descriptions follow the table.
