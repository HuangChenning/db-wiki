### 10.13.3 Multi-Byte Character Support for Complex Character Sets

If you want to add support for a new character set named *`MYSET`* that includes multibyte characters, you must use multibyte character functions in the ``ctype-*`MYSET`*.c`` source file in the `strings` directory.

The existing character sets provide the best documentation and examples to show how these functions are implemented. Look at the `ctype-*.c` files in the `strings` directory, such as the files for the `euc_kr`, `gb2312`, `gbk`, `sjis`, and `ujis` character sets. Take a look at the `MY_CHARSET_HANDLER` structures to see how they are used. See also the `CHARSET_INFO.txt` file in the `strings` directory for additional information.
