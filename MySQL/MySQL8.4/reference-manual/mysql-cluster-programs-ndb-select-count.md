MySQL 8.4 Reference Manual Including MySQL NDB Cluster 8.4

### 25.5.26 ndb\_select\_count — Print Row Counts for NDB Tables

**ndb\_select\_count** prints the number of rows in one or more [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md) tables. With a single table, the result is equivalent to that obtained by using the MySQL statement ``SELECT COUNT(*) FROM         *`tbl_name`*``.

#### Usage

```
ndb_select_count [-c connection_string] -ddb_name tbl_name[, tbl_name2[, ...]]
```

Options that can be used with **ndb\_select\_count** are shown in the following table. Additional descriptions follow the table.

	| Default Value (Unix) | `$HOME/ndb-tls` |
	| Default Value (Windows) | `$HOMEDIR/ndb-tls` |
	Specify a list of directories to search for a CA file. On Unix platforms, the directory names are separated by colons (`:`); on Windows systems, the semicolon character (`;`) is used as the separator. A directory reference may be relative or absolute; it may contain one or more environment variables, each denoted by a prefixed dollar sign (`$`), and expanded prior to use.
	Searching begins with the leftmost named directory and proceeds from left to right until a file is found. An empty string denotes an empty search path, which causes all searches to fail. A string consisting of a single dot (`.`) indicates that the search path limited to the current working directory.
	If no search path is supplied, the compiled-in default value is used. This value depends on the platform used: On Windows, this is `\ndb-tls`; on other platforms (including Linux), it is `$HOME/ndb-tls`. This can be overridden by compiling NDB Cluster using [`-DWITH_NDB_TLS_SEARCH_PATH`](source-configuration-options.md).
- `--no-defaults`
	| Command-Line Format | `--no-defaults` |
	| --- | --- |
	Do not read default options from any option file other than login file.

	Print program argument list and exit.
- `--usage`
	| Command-Line Format | `--usage` |
	| --- | --- |
	Display help text and exit; same as `--help`.
- `--version`
	| Command-Line Format | `--version` |
	| --- | --- |
	Display version information and exit.

You can obtain row counts from multiple tables in the same database by listing the table names separated by spaces when invoking this command, as shown under **Sample Output**.

#### Sample Output

```
$> ./ndb_select_count -c localhost -d ctest1 fish dogs
6 records in table fish
4 records in table dogs
```
