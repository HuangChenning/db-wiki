MySQL 8.0 Reference Manual Including MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0

### 25.5.8 ndb\_delete\_all — Delete All Rows from an NDB Table

**ndb\_delete\_all** deletes all rows from the given [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md) table. In some cases, this can be much faster than [`DELETE`](delete.md) or even [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md).

#### Usage

```
ndb_delete_all -c connection_string tbl_name -d db_name
```

This deletes all rows from the table named *`tbl_name`* in the database named *`db_name`*. It is exactly equivalent to executing ``TRUNCATE         *`db_name`*.*`tbl_name`*`` in MySQL.

Options that can be used with **ndb\_delete\_all** are shown in the following table. Additional descriptions follow the table.

In NDB 7.6 and earlier, this program printed ``NDBT_ProgramExit -         *`status`*`` upon completion of its run, due to an unnecessary dependency on the `NDBT` testing library. This dependency has been removed in NDB 8.0, eliminating the extraneous output.
